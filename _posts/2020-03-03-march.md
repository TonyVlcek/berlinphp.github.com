                  <h4>Reset --hard your fear</h4>

                  <p>Many developers have a fear of git reset command because of its reputation for being dangerous.</p> 

                  <p>While it is true that the reset command can be dangerous and cause you to lose your changes like tears in the rain, as it is with many fears, it's mostly based on a lack of understanding.</p>

                  <p>So let's give your fear of the reset command an antidote -  a proper understanding of how git reset works.</p>

                      I've been exploring <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose"></a>WeaveWorks' footloose</a> ("Containers which look like VMs") for local development and CI.
                      My talk is most likely going to be a (hopefully bug-free) live-demo of how I installed and use footloose.
                      And if this works too well, then we can look at footloose' integration with Ignite (AWS FireCracker).
